Trading Agentic App
This is a modular, autonomous, self-learning trading intelligence system built to detect early alpha signals, execute precision trades, and evolve over time through recursive memory and adaptive agents.

It supports:

Crypto, macro, and equities domains
Real-time signal ingestion
Swarm-based decision arbitration
Asymmetry scoring to detect rare alpha
Execution via futures, options, spreads
Geographic and global trend overlays
Dynamic confidence and risk tuning
Designed to outperform institutional bots by operating higher in the signal funnel at a fraction of the cost.
